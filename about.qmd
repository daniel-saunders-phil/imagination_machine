I'm a principal data scientist at PyMC Labs, a consulting firm that specializes in
building Bayesian models to handle business problems. The firm grew out of the 
open source project, [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html), a truly 
wonderful piece of software. 

In the recent past, I was a PhD student at the University of British Columbia in the
philosophy program. I worked on topics in evolutionary game theory, philosophy of science,
and cultural evolution. You can find my published work [here](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=GD912IAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

I occasionally blog about related topics on this website.
